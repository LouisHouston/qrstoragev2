# This website is a personal project
## Goal
The goal of this website is to make a project that showcases my skills.
The main object of the project itself is that people usually have storage bins that they use for either seasonal items. With this you can upload pictures of the storage bin's contents and then print a QR code to tape to the bin and then use your camera to scan the QR code if you ever wanted to look up what exactly was in the box
### Techologies I used
React, JavaScript, Typescript, Bootstrap5 for the menu bar, Firebase as backend with google authentication, HTML5, CSS
